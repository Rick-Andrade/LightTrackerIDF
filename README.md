# LightTrackerIDF

> Status: Developing ⚠️

## Task of ESP-IDF Course

This project was developed as a final assignment of the ESP32 course using ESP-IDF.

This prjkect is an embedded application that consists of a photovoltaic panel mounted on a mechanical structure called pan-tilt. The objective is to make the panel generate the greatest amount of energy possible by following the light rays. To monitor the generated energy, the microcontroller plays the role of a client and sends the data to a node red server via the GET method.

## Task requiriments:
* Use only ESP-IDF native resources
* Build an IoT application

## Implemented features:
+ ADC reader
+ Servo motor controll in horizontal orientation
+ WiFi connection
+ http client

## Features in developing:
+ Servo motor controll in vertical orientation
+ Dashboard in server side
